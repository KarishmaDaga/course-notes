# Math 281: Real Analysis
The goal of the course is to be able to understand and calculate with sequences and series of real numbers and real valued functions.  The basic problem is to expand a  function  into  a  series  and  then  to  perform  operations  on  this  series:  addition,  multiplication, differentiation, and integration.  Along the way we shall learn how to write a mathematical proof, develop some topology of R^n and tools for dealing with convergence of infinite series.
