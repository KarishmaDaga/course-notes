# CISC 342: Operating Systems

## Course Details
Office Hours: Monday, 10:30 - 12 Room 241
TB: Operating Systems Concepts (Dinosaur Book) 

### Lecture 1
Dfn: An **operating system** is a special layer of software that provides applicationsoftware access to hardware resources 
- Convenient abstraction of complex hardware devices
- Protected access to shared resources
- Security and authentication
- provides and environment in which programs can do useful work

What does an OS do?
- Provide abstractions to applications
	- file systems
	- processes, threads
	- virtual machine, containers
	- naming system, etc
- manage resources
	- memory, cpu, storage, etc
- achieves the above by implementing specific algorithms and techniques
	- scheduling
	- concurrency
	- transactions
	- security

Moore's Law
- Microprocessors have become smaller, denser, and more powerful
- Slowdown in Joy's law of performance
