# CS and Math Course Notes

I type up my handwritten lecture notes from my cs and math classes so that I don't die around 
midterms/finals/etc, and I thought it would be a good idea to share them online! Everything is written in markdown for ease and I update these notes throughout the semester. For more theory heavy courses like rings and fields or stats, I'll just upload pictures of my handwritten notes.
