# CS and Math Course Notes

I type up my handwritten lecture notes from my cs and math classes so that I don't die around 
midterms/finals/etc, and I thought it would be a good idea to share them online! Everything is written in markdown for ease and I update these notes throughout the semester.

I'd greatly appreciate reports of any typos and factual errors you find. Open an issue if you find something that should be fixed.
