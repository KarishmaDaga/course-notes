## Programming Paradigms
* a framework for thinking about programming
* a pattern or model for how we program
* just like software engineering is defined by different methodologies, programming languages are defined by differing _paradigms_
* some languages are designed to support one paradigm (ex: Haskell supports functional programming) while other programming languages support multiple paradigms (ex: Java, C++, Scala, Python, Scheme, etc)

### Types of Paradigms
1. Procedural/Imperative: giving commands to the computer
  * e.g.: accessing and modifying memory
  * languages: assembly, C, fortran, Pascal
2. Object oriented: describe data structures and what you can do with them
  * e.g.: C++, Java, Kotlin, etc.
  * note: the methods are still imperative!
3. Event-driven: describes how to react to events
  * e.g.: JavaFX
4. Functional: describes the desired result in mathematical forms
  * programs are treated as a sequence of stateless function evaluations
  * e.g.: Haskell, Lisp, ML, Rust ðŸ’–
5. Logical: describes logical properties, relationships between values
  * e.g.: Prolog
6. Others: event simulation, tree transformation, etc.

### Applications of Haskell
* financial analysis (OCaml @Jane Street)
* modelling (biochemistry)
* internal tools @facebook
* managing clusters of servers @google

### Applications of Prolog:
* environmental systems (weather predictions)
* Boeing corp, electrical assembly tasks
* geology: finding gold
* rapid prototyping of AI problems
